The scope has changed really, but fuck it, when you are the client and the 
developer, scope creep doesn't sound as evil.

So... Broach is still a game engine, but we have decided to implement an  
Entity Component System, we hope that this way of composing objects is better than 
an architecture that favours inheritance


Broach
=
Broach is a game engine, under active development. The target is 2d games. We
know that its a "bad idea" to reinvent the wheel (more alternatives like cocos2d exist).
But this is going to be more fun, and an opportunity to learn something new.

What we want eventually
==
* Scene management
* Tree structure for sprite management (think cocos2d)
* Event system.

Feel free to submit a pull request, or maybe help out by effecting the course
which development follows.

Resources

There is a wealth of information on entity component systems, to get you started look at:

Getting Started
=
The best part to start getting into code is looking at the Button class and its usage in
scene subclasses {NewGame, MainMenu, Continue}.
