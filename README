Broach
=

Broach is a game engine, under active development. The target is 2d games. We
know that its a "bad idea" to reinvent the wheel (more alternatives like cocos2d exist).
But this is going to be more fun, and maybe an opportunity to learn something new.

What we want eventually
==
* Scene management
* Tree structure for sprite management (think cocos2d)
* Event system.

Feel free to submit a pull request, or maybe help out by effecting the course
which development follows.
